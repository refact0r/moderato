## contributing

1. fork this repository or download it
2. go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and create a new application
3. go to the Bot page and copy the token
4. paste the token inside the quotes `token = ""` in the `bot.py` file from this repository
5. run `bot.py`, it should say `bot has connected to discord` in your terminal
6. to invite the bot to a server, go back to discord developer portal and go to the OAuth2 page
7. scroll down to the OAuth2 URL Generator and check the box that says bot inside the scopes box
8. then in the bot permissions box and check permissions that you want the bot to have
9. copy the link in the scopes box, visit it, and complete all the normal stuff for inviting bots
10. hopefully the bot should be online and commands that don't require a database will work
