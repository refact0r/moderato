a discord bot

## contributing

1. fork repository or download
2. go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application
3. go to the Bot page and copy token
4. put the token inside the quotes `token = ""` in bot.py
5. run bot.py, it should say "bot has connected to discord" in your terminal
6. to invite the bot to a server, go back to discord developer portal and go to the OAuth2 page
7. scroll down to the OAuth2 URL Generator and check the box that says bot inside the scopes box
8. then in the bot permissions box pick permissions (preferably admin)
9. copy the link in the scopes box, visit it, and complete all the normal stuff for inviting bots
10. hopefully it worked
